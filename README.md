This project reqires the use of pandas, numpy, collections, and matplotlib libraries. Additionally, the datasets can be acquired from stack overflow <a href = "https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey">here</a>.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of my initial study into data science, I utilized annual survey data from Stack Overflow to answer the following questions:

1. What programming languages are developers utilizing?
2. What platforms are developers building for?
3. What factors may effect the job satisfaction of developers?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The repository contains 3 individual notebooks, each answering a specific question as listed above.
